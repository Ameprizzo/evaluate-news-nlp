# News Article NLP
# Project Instructions
Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing
What We will be building
We will be building web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. Using an exciting new api called Aylien, we can build a simple web interface to interact with their NLP system. This tool will give us back pertinent information about the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.

The goal of this project is to give practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Creating layouts and page design
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls

On top of that, I want to introduce you to the topic of Natural Language Processing. NLPs leverage machine learning and deep learning create a program that can interpret natural human speech. Systems like Alexa, Google Assistant, and many voice interaction programs are well known to us, but understanding human speech is an incredibly difficult task and requires a lot of resources to achieve. Full disclosure, this is the Wikipedia definition, but I found it to be a clear one:

> Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence
concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages, in particular how to program computers to
process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

You could spend years and get a masters degree focusing on the details of creating NLP systems and algorithms. Typically, NLP programs require far more resources than individuals have access to, but a fairly new API called Aylien has put a public facing API in front of their NLP system. We will use it in this project to determine various attributes of an article or blog post.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
So, fork this repo and begin your project setup.

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`
This will install all required packages for this project since it included in `package.json`

## Setting up the API

### Step 1: Signup for an API key
First, you will need to go [here](https://developer.aylien.com/signup). Signing up will get you an API key. Don't worry, at the time of this course, the API is free to use up to 1000 requests per day or 333 intensive requests. It is free to check how many requests you have remaining for the day.


### Step 2: Environment Variables

- [ ] Create a new ```.env``` file in the root of your project
- [ ] Go to your .gitignore file and add ```.env``` - this will make sure that we don't push our environment variables to Github! If you forget this step, all of the work we did to protect our API keys was pointless.
- [ ] Fill the .env file with your API keys like this:
```
API_ID=**************************
API_KEY=**************************
```

### Step 5: Using the API

We're ready to go! The API has a lot of different endpoints you can take a look at [here](https://docs.aylien.com/textapi/endpoints/#api-endpoints). And you can see how using the SDK simplifies the requests we need to make. 

I won't provide further examples here, as it's up to you to create the various requests and make sure your server is set up appropriately.

## After the Aylien API

- Test that the site is now available even when you stop your local serverâ€¨

## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it! Unfortunately its a bit out of scope for me to explain too much about how to do that here, but checkout [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) for some really intuitive free hosting options.
